- 👋 Hi, I’m @KellyJacobson
- I am a student at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering. I will graduate May, 2022.
- I am most interested in app development and have some school-related experience with android studios.
I haven't decided exactly which direction I want my career to take, so I am learning as much as I can now until I figure out what fits me.
